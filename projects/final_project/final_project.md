# Final Project

Your final project must be a web application with the following major components:

* **Flask** framework
* **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL** database
* Consistent and appealing user interface
* RESTful API

## Technical specification

* Multiple routes

* Multiple templates

* Make use of **persistent data** - something must be stored and accessed from the database
  * Use *psycopg2*, *records*, or another Python DB API
  * Use *SQLite3* or *PostgreSQL* DBMS
  * **1-3** tables required

* Some type of form processing so that your application is **interactive**
  * Use *GET* and *POST* methods

* Aesthetically appealing and consistent user interface
  * Use *Bootstrap* or another framework
  * *Vue* or another JavaScript framework

* Use and provide an API:
  * Access your app's API using JavaScript

* Deploy your application on the web

* At least 1 (one) additional **new** component/technology. Note that you may have to learn that technology yourself.

  * *requests* to communicate with an external API
  * Use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instead of a relational database
  * Something else (vetted by me)
